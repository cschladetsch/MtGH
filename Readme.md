# Magic the Gathering Helper

Just a simple Android client using Unity3d.

The main interesting points are use of the new VideoPlayer Unity3d class, and the mix of 3D physics over a 2D UGUI.

## Usage

It's all pretty simply. To bring up the menu, tap anywhere on the top title bar.

## Note about Assets

There were some large assets in Assets/Movies and Assets/Music that I excluded from the project. 

1. Because I stole them.
1. Because they were large.

The game will still run without them. Just with no background music or video.
