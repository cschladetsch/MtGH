# Magic the Gathering Helper

Just a simple client using Unity3d. Works on pretty much anything, though I did take the short-cut of normalising to my personal phone's resolution.

That said, I mostly followed best practicce for dealing with various aspect ratios. 

The main interesting technical points are use of the new VideoPlayer Unity3d class, and the mix of 3D physics over a 2D UGUI, and also simplicity of the code.

## Usage

It's all pretty straight-forward. To bring up the menu, tap anywhere on the top title bar.

Yeah, the names 'Saxon' and 'Dad' are hard-coded - because that is the sole usage I saw for it at the time.

## Note about Assets

There were some large assets in Assets/Movies and Assets/Music that I excluded from the project. 

1. Because I stole them.
1. Because they were large.

The game will still run without them - just with no background music or video.
